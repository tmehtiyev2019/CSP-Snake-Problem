# Constrained Characters Puzzle Solver: Snake Problem
This Python script solves a constrained character placement puzzle on a square grid. The goal of the puzzle is to fill the empty cells with letters of the alphabet in such a way that each letter has at least one neighboring cell (horizontally or vertically) containing the previous or next letter in the alphabet. The script uses a backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution if one exists.

## Functions
* is_valid_move(board, x, y, ch)
This function checks if placing the character ch at position (x, y) in the board is a valid move.

* is_solution_valid(board)
This function checks if the entire board is a valid solution.

* find_most_constrained_position(board)
This function finds the most constrained unassigned position in the board. This position has the most filled neighboring cells.

* solve_csp(board, letters, remaining_slots, index=0)
This function solves the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) by filling the remaining_slots in the board using the given letters.

* main()
This function defines the initial board, calculates the number of remaining slots, creates a set of available letters, and calls the solve_csp function to find a solution. If a solution is found, it prints the board; otherwise, it prints an appropriate message.


The script will either print the solved board or a message indicating that no feasible solution exists. You can modify the board variable in the main() function to try different puzzles.
